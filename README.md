# MEP
MEP stands for 'Manage External Packages'.

Every organization I have worked in uses some kind of configuratin management to track the use of third party libraries such as boost. I find this overkill for most cases. Organizations only need to provide the compressed binaries along with an automated method of installing them on developer machines. MEP is an attempt to create such an automation, using CMake.
